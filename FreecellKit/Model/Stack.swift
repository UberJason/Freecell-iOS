/// Stack public interface puts the most recent item at the END of the array
/// and oldest item at the FRONT of the array. Reason is so when rendering
/// the stack in UI, can simply iterate over the items and lay them down one by one.

/// The internal implementations put the most recent item at the FRONT of the array
/// and oldest item at the BACK of the array. Reason is so when pushing one stack
/// onto another, can simply insert the new stack at index 0 on the old one.
